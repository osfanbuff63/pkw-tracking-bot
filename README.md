## About

This is a [Discord](https://discord.com) bot to track Parkour Warrior Dojo statistics from the Minecraft server [MCC Island](https://mcchampionship.com). Currently there is no public instance, so you will need to host your own. A keep_alive file for Replit is included, but the environment variable `REPLIT` must be set to `1` to trigger it.

## License

This project is licensed under the Apache-2.0 license and is compliant with the [REUSE specification](https://reuse.software).
